		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px; font-family: georgie;">I am not a person who enjoys social situations. As a result, I am hesitant to work, and as a result, I lack experience in the work environment. However, after finishing SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia), I went to my sister's house in Johor and worked in a restaurant there. I didn't stay long since I felt I couldn't afford to be among so many people.</p>
